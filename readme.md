# Polymorphing Immunity

A Noita mod that adds a perk to the game which prevents its user from being
affected by most forms of polymorphing. This includes stains of polymorphine
(regular, unstable, and chaotic) and the spells of Muodonmuutosmestari (Master
of Polymorphing) and Hahmonvaihtaja (Shapechanger).


## Installation

Copy the contents of the `Source` folder to the `mods` folder under your Noita
installation path. Once this is done, the mod has to be enabled in Noita's mod
menu.


## Usage

The perk is added to the default perk list and should be randomly encountered in
places where perks are normally found.


## Compatibility

The mod was developed for the Apr 23 2021 version of Noita. It doesn't overwrite
any of the game's base files, so encountering mod clashes with it is unlikely.


## License

For the Noita mod licensing terms please refer to the modding agreement bundled
with the game.


## Credits

The new perk's icon is a modified version of another immunity icon included in
the vanilla game. The mod was developed by Gabor Soos.
